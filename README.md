# rldatix_assignment

This repository contains work completed for a data science assignment, covering both structured and unstructured healthcare data.

## Project Overview

- **Task 1:** Predict 30-day hospital readmission using structured clinical features.
- **Task 2:** Extract clinical entities from discharge notes using a zero-shot large language model (LLM).

## Repository Structure

- `data/` — Folder containing the structured dataset and discharge notes.
- `environment.yaml` — Full Conda environment specification for reproducibility.
- `requirements.txt` — pip-style requirements file for quick setup.
- `task_1.ipynb` — Notebook for classification modelling using structured data.
- `task_2.ipynb` — Notebook for NLP-based entity extraction using LLM prompts.
- `write_up.ipynb` — One-page summary of approach, results, and practical implications.
- `ydata_report.html` — Automated EDA report generated with ydata-profiling.
